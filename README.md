This is 2 very basic Lua scripts for the Minecraft mod ComputerCraft. It is for controlling a reactor and turbine for Bigger Reactors. The EnergyCell.lua is to be run on a computer next to an energy cell from Powah and either have a wireless redstone transmitter or a redstone line connected to it. The ReactorControl.lua is to be run on a computer connected to a reactor and turbine via the computercraft cables. It should have the redstone line from the Energy Cell computer connected to it.
